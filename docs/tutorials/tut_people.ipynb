    "## Data requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Covasim is intentionally designed to be flexible with data requirements, acknowledging that some settings have large amounts of data, while others have very little. There are, however, some minimum data requirements if a real-world context is being modeled (as opposed to a theoretical exploration). These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Population size:** To interpret results correctly, you need to know what the correct denominator is. Typically this is the city or country you're modeling, but sometimes it's not as simple as it may seem, especially early in an epidemic when cases tend to be concentrated near the source of the outbreak.\n",
    "- **Deaths per day:** Often considered to be the most reliable source of data, since deaths tend to be under-reported less than infections; however, significant under-reporting can still occur, so always treat reported deaths as the *lower* limit of the true value.\n",
    "- **Diagnosed cases per day:** Diagnosed cases are the most responsive measure of the epidemic conditions; however, they are dependent on both the number of infections and the testing rate. In settings with low or highly variable rates of testing, they may not be especially reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these essential data requirements, several other pieces of data are useful to have. These are:\n",
    "- **Seroprevalence:** Although seroprevalence rates wane over time, they are generally a more reliable indicator of total infections than diagnosed cases.\n",
    "- **Tests per day:** The number of tests can be used directly in the `test_num` intervention (see Tutorial 5), and is very useful for interpreting diagnoses data.\n",
    "- **Vaccinations per day:** In locations with high vaccination rates, understanding when the vaccines were rolled out (and with which vaccines) is important for estimating current immunity levels.\n",
    "- **Policy interventions:** While changes in transmission can often be seen directly in the data on cases and deaths, at minimum it is a useful sanity check to see if these changes line up with changes in policy such as mobility restrictions or mask mandates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covasim 在设计上有意灵活处理数据要求，因为有些环境拥有大量数据，而有些环境则数据很少。但是，如果要模拟真实世界的环境（而不是理论探索），则有一些最低数据要求。这些要求是\n",
    "\n",
    "- **人口规模：** 要正确解释结果，需要知道正确的分母是什么。通常情况下，这是您正在建模的城市或国家，但有时并不像看起来那么简单，尤其是在流行病早期，病例往往集中在爆发源附近。\n",
    "- **每日死亡人数：** 通常被认为是最可靠的数据来源，因为死亡人数的漏报往往少于感染人数；但仍可能出现严重的漏报，因此应始终将报告的死亡人数视为真实值的下限。\n",
    "- **每日确诊病例数：** 确诊病例数是对流行病状况反应最灵敏的衡量指标，但它取决于感染人数和检测率。在检测率较低或变化很大的环境中，它们可能并不特别可靠。\n",
    "\n",
    "除了这些基本的数据要求外，其他一些数据也很有用。它们是\n",
    "- **血清流行率：** 尽管血清流行率会随着时间的推移而降低，但与确诊病例相比，血清流行率通常是更可靠的总感染指标。\n",
    "- **每天检测次数：** 检测次数可直接用于 “test_num ”干预（见教程 5），对解释诊断数据非常有用。\n",
    "- **每天接种疫苗数：** 在疫苗接种率较高的地区，了解疫苗的接种时间（以及接种的疫苗）对于估算当前的免疫水平非常重要。\n",
    "- **政策干预：** 虽然通常可以直接从病例和死亡数据中看到传播的变化，但至少可以检查这些变化是否与政策变化（如流动限制或口罩规定）一致。"

The hybrid option provides four *contact layers*: households `'h'`, schools `'s'`, workplaces `'w'`, and community interactions `'c'`. Each layer is defined by (a) which agents are connected to which other agents, and (b) the weight of each connection (i.e., transmission probability). Specifically:\n",
